YOLOv11 Weapon Detection and Tracking 🚀

**Project Overview 🛡️**

This project is part of our final year research on Weapon Detection and Tracking using various YOLO models. Our goal is to identify the most accurate YOLO version for real-time weapon detection.

**Group Members 👥**

Neha Choudhary (Leader),
Sneha Das,
Amanpreet Kaur,
Chetna Saraf,
Dhanesh Dadheech,

**Mentor 👨‍🏫**

Abhishek Sir (HOD, AI/ML Department)

**My Role: YOLOv11 Testing 🧪**

I was responsible for testing YOLOv11 on various input sources:
📷 Images
🎥 Videos
🎦 Webcam

**Workflow ⚡**

1.Dataset Preparation 📂

- Downloaded dataset from Roboflow
- Performed augmentation on the dataset using PyCharm

2.Model Training 🎯

- Trained YOLOv11 model using Google Colab (A100 GPU) for better performance

3.Testing & Evaluation 📊

- Tested the trained YOLOv11 model on images, videos, and live webcam feed
- Evaluated accuracy and detection speed

**Comparison 📈**

Each group member trained and tested a different YOLO version:

Sneha Das - YOLOv8,
Amanpreet Kaur - YOLOv9,
Dhanesh Dadheech - YOLOv7,
Chetna Saraf - YOLOv5,

We compared all models to determine which one achieves the best accuracy. The best-performing model will be finalized for our project. 🎯

**Tools & Technologies 🛠️**
